Port of the MOBL game by KD-LAB on SFML.

This game is based on other people's old recreations of MOBL using the rules that came with the game.

This is not a completely accurate port.
I added my game visual and a couple of mechanics.
The rest of the game follows the original concept.

You can do whatever you want with it, within reason and with credit to the original author.
